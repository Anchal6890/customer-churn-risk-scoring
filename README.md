# 📊 Customer Churn Risk Scoring (SQL | Python | AI)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem that directly impacts revenue.  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn and assigning **AI-driven risk scores** by combining **SQL for data extraction**, **Python for data analysis**, and **Machine Learning (AI)** for prediction.

The goal is to help businesses **identify high-risk customers early** and take proactive retention actions.
